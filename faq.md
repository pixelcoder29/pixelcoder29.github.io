# Yard Guards PDX – FAQ

## General Questions

**Q: What is Yard Guards PDX?**  
A: We provide weekly dog waste removal services to keep your yard clean, safe, and fresh. Our team comes to your home on a recurring schedule and removes waste from your yard so you don’t have to worry about it.

**Q: How does the service work?**  
A: After signing up and confirming payment, we schedule your first service within 7–13 days, depending on routing and availability. After your first visit, we continue weekly on the same day and within the same time window.  

*Note:* First-time pickups may take longer than usual (up to 1 hour or more) depending on the amount of waste. Please keep pets secured for the entire service window. Repeat weekly visits typically take 10–15 minutes.  

*Tip:* Clearing large toys, garden tools, or obstacles from your yard before the first visit helps ensure a smooth service. Make sure gates are ready to be opened by our team.

**Q: How do I sign up?**  
A: Signing up is quick and completely online. Click the “Sign Up” button in the navigation menu on our website. You’ll be taken to a short form where you’ll enter your service details and complete payment securely. Once submitted, we’ll schedule your first service and send you a confirmation email.

**Q: Do I need to sign a contract?**  
A: No. Our service is flexible — you can cancel anytime, but all charges are final (see billing section).

**Q: Where do you provide service?**  
A: Yard Guards PDX serves Portland, Oregon. If you’re unsure whether your address is eligible, email us at [service@yardguardspdx.com](mailto:service@yardguardspdx.com).

**Q: Can my service day or time change?**  
A: Yes. To optimize routing and efficiency, we may adjust service day or time. We’ll notify you in advance of any changes.

## Scheduling & Service

**Q: When will my service occur?**  
A: Services are scheduled within 7–13 days after payment and as soon as possible after your address is added to our route. Services then repeat weekly on the same day, unless we contact you to adjust your schedule.

**Q: What happens if my service is missed?**  
A: If we cannot access your yard or your pets are not secured, we will attempt to contact you twice by phone, once by door knock, and once via text. If we still cannot reach you, the service for that day will be skipped, marked as completed, and your next weekly service will continue as scheduled. No refunds will be given for missed service.

**Q: How long does each service take?**  
A: Most services take around 10–15 minutes, but first pickups or yards with multiple piles may take a little longer.

**Q: What happens in extreme weather or unsafe conditions?**  
A: Yard Guards PDX may delay or skip service in cases of extreme weather, flooding, or other unsafe conditions. However, we always do our best to complete your service each week. Your next scheduled service will continue as normal.  

*Note:* Yard Guards PDX is not liable for missed service due to events beyond our reasonable control, including severe weather, flooding, or natural disasters.

**Q: What exactly is included in the service?**  
A: Our service removes dog waste only. Yard Guards PDX is not responsible for unusual debris such as fallen branches, trash, or other non-dog waste items.

## Payments & Billing

**Q: How do I pay?**  
A: Payments are processed securely through Stripe. If you didn’t complete payment during signup, check the first confirmation email you received after signing up for the payment link.  

*Note:* Payments are automatically charged each month for weekly service.

**Q: Is there a first-time free service?**  
A: Yes! Your first pickup is free.

**Q: How often will I be billed?**  
A: Billing is monthly for weekly service. You will receive a receipt from Stripe after each payment.

**Q: Can I get a refund?**  
A: No. All charges are final. Canceling stops future billing, but service continues until the end of the current billing cycle. No partial refunds will be given.

**Q: How do I cancel my service?**  
A: You can cancel your service anytime by emailing us at [service@yardguardspdx.com](mailto:service@yardguardspdx.com). Future billing will stop automatically. Your service will continue until the end of your current billing cycle. If you’d like us to stop service immediately, just let us know — we’ll respect your request, but charges for visits within the current billing period are non-refundable.

**Q: Can I pause service temporarily?**  
A: You can pause service as needed by contacting us — we’ll work with you to manage your schedule.

**Q: What if a payment fails?**  
A: If your payment fails due to insufficient funds, expired card, or other issues, we will attempt to contact you to update your payment information. Service may be paused until payment is successfully processed.  

*Tip:* Please contact us first if you have concerns about payments before disputing through your bank or Stripe.

## Yard & Pet Safety

**Q: Do I need to be home during service?**  
A: No. You do not need to be home, but your yard must be accessible and pets must be secured.

**Q: What if my pets are outside?**  
A: For the safety of pets and staff, pets must be secured. If they are outside, we will attempt to contact you twice by phone, once by door knock, and once via text. If we still cannot reach you, the service will be skipped and marked as completed for that day and will resume the following week. No refunds will be given for skipped services.

**Q: Are your staff trained to handle pets?**  
A: Yes and our staff loves pets, but for everyone’s safety, pets must remain secured during service.
